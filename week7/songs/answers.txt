-- If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Here's more indept data about the person's  music listening preferences based on average energy, violence and danceability.

ENERGY
Average energy of music is 0.659

VALENCE
Average valence of music is 0.484

DANCEABILITY
Average is 0.716

Conclusion:
The valence of music that the user listened to was average.
Showing that the user listens to both happy and sad music.
Hence I would conclude that the user is from the Blue mood group.
This person seeks out music to feel their feelings our loud.

-- Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

I think that the data from his top 100 songs might be not accurate so we might need to capture more data too.
